What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I picked up on Git and command line surprisingly quickly but was struggling with GitHub- how to push, pull, merge, how do I know if my branches are connecting to the right place etc

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I got much more comfortable working in Github. Working through the entire workflow with a partner helped me to clarify how the whole process will take place once we are actually collaborating on projects on GitHub.  Also, it was really helpful to see what happens when there's a merge conflict!

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

So I actually had to reset my GitHub password at the beginning of the GPS.  My pair helped me figure out how to run git config to update it in the terminal.  Fetch was new to me and my guide explained fetch/merge vs pull. 


What still confuses you about Git?

I could use more practice with pushing things to GitHub and pulling down from GitHub- making sure I've got the most updated version of the file.  I think I get most confused when using git push becuse I am not always certain what to put for the "remote" "origin".  



How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?  

It was great!  I enjoyed working with Regina and thought we collaborated well.  I was a little bit nervous beforehand because I didn't know what it was going to be like having a guide watching the session, but I quickly realized that he was there to be supportive, not to be critical.
